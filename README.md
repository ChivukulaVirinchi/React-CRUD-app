# CRUD App This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app built with React. It allows you to manage a list of employees with their name, email and phone number. This project is based on the original version developed by [Safdar Jamal](https://github.com/SafdarJamal/crud-app), who kindly shared his code and tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqgQxmhKUTA). The main improvement made by me is to reduce the number of states declared in the App component, and use a single state for employee details. This makes the code more concise and easier to manage. ## How to run the project To run the project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project after cloning from git: 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. 2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. 3. Run `npm start` to start the development server. 4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action. ## How to use the app The app has a simple interface that allows you to perform the following operations: - To add a new employee, click on the `Add Employee` button at the top right corner. A modal will pop up where you can enter the employee details and click on `Save`. - To view an employee's details, click on the employee's name in the table. A modal will pop up where you can see the employee details and click on `Close`. - To edit an employee's details, click on the edit icon (pencil) next to the employee's name in the table. A modal will pop up where you can edit the employee details and click on `Update`. - To delete an employee, click on the delete icon (trash) next to the employee's name in the table. A confirmation dialog will appear where you can click on `Yes` to delete the employee or `No` to cancel. ## How to contribute If you have any suggestions or feedback for improving this project, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
